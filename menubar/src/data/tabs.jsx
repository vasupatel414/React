        'discription':'Vision is the process by which the eyes and brain work together to interpret light and create an image of the surrounding environment. Light enters the eye through the cornea, passes through the pupil, and is focused by the lens onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains photoreceptor cells, called rods and cones, which convert light into electrical signals. These signals are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain processes these signals in the visual cortex, allowing us to perceive shapes, colors, and motion. Vision is a complex and dynamic process that enables us to interact with and navigate the world around us.',
